BlueDEX is a decentralized Ethereum Token Exchange with the most ERC20 listings of any exchange.


# What is BlueDEX?
BlueDEX currently acts as an open source, updated interface for EtherDelta's smart contract with an active and public development team. Although BlueDEX started as a fork of EtherDelta, considerable development time has been put towards a new token listing system, order book, API, and front-end UI all of which are at different stages of development and can be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/bluedex/). 


# How does BlueDEX Work?
BlueDEX currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract (described in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6kdiyl/smart_contract_overview/)) which allows BlueDEX users to trade utilizing EtherDelta's volume.


# What is the Roadmap for BlueDEX?
The BlueDEX Roadmap is maintained at https://bluedex.github.io/about/


# Contribute
We welcome contributions from the community. You can contribute by improving the code, documentation, or by donating. 
BlueDEX currently interfaces with EtherDelta's original smart contract which allows BlueDEX users to trade utilizing EtherDelta's volume. However, this means that the trading fees still go to EtherDelta and BlueDEX development costs come entirely out of our pockets. If you are interested in the BlueDEX project and would like to contribute to its future, please consider donating to the following Ethereum address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x3a2aEdc3B54A99e429ae36637681d4560cE5C05b">0x3a2aEdc3B54A99e429ae36637681d4560cE5C05b</a>

As this is a project by the community, for the community, transactions to and from the donations address will be public and can be viewed on the blockchain. We will also keep a public ledger of how the donations are distributed. That way, donors can see exactly how their donations are helping!
